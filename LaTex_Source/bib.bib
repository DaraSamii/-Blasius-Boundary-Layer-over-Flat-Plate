abstract = {A single-term, two-parameter, hyperbolic tangent function is presented to describe the flow profiles in the Blasius boundary layer, which reproduces the streamwise velocity profile within 0.003 (0.3% of free stream velocity) of its numerical exact solution throughout the flow. The function can be inverted for an implicit description of the velocity profile.}
